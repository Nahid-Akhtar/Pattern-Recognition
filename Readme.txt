The sample input lists are in the 'Input' folder.
The code takes all the files in this folder as input and produces output with detected pattern.
The code has some limitation like it is only able to understand or detect one pattern from the list.

Note:
You can add any file with some list of elements in the 'Input' Folder for testing.
I tested on zipcode, iban, billing amount and date.
